# QR Attendance Tracking PWA

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) for attendance tracking using QR codes. This application allows students to mark their attendance by scanning a QR code and entering their matric number and name. Admins can manage class sessions, track attendance, and generate reports.

## Features

### Student Features:
- **Submit Attendance Once Per Day**: Students can only submit attendance once per day for each course.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Scan a static QR code with the PWA or any QR code scanner app.
- **Local Storage**: After submitting their attendance, the studentâ€™s details (matric number and name) are saved in the local storage to prevent multiple entries on the same day for that course.

### Admin Features:
- **Class Management**: Admins can create new classes with start and stop times.
- **Attendance Tracking**: View attendance records for each class.
- **Export Attendance**: Export attendance lists to PDF.
- **Print QR Code**: Print the QR code for the class, which students can scan to submit attendance.

### Access Control:
- **Students**: Can only submit attendance once per day for each course.
- **Admins**: Can view and download attendance records.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Prisma
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL
